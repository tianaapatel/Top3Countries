# ***Switzerland***
In the summer of 2022, I went to Europe for 2 weeks and was able to travel to 4 different countries. These countries included: Switzerland, Italy, France, and Spain. No matter where we were, we made sure that we ate good food while we were there.
### Switzerland
My journey began in Switzerland for 2 days. During my time in Switzerland, I went on numerous adventures with my friends. One of my favorite memories in Switzerland was pedal boating in the bay. Switzerland was one of my favorite places that I visited. I found it so fascinating how the water was absolutely so refreshing and it was so good, Zurich water to be exact. Everything about Switzerland was so refreshing and a clean environment. I wish I could breathe that air FOREVER!

### Italy
In Italy, we did a lot of swimming activities where and travelled to different cities. I admired the architecture and the colorful buildings that made the city more lively. One of my favorite activities was midnight swimming. It was so pretty at night, with the moonn at the center
### France
### Spain
